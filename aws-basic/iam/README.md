# AWS IAM Practice

This folder contains files to help practice AWS IAM

## What I practiced
- Created a new IAM user with programmatic and console access
- Added the user to a group with "AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess" policy
- Created a custom IAM role and attached a basic S3 access policy
- (Optional) Enabled MFA for enhanced security

## Key Concepts
- IAM User VS IAM Role
- IAM Policy
- Least privilege principle
- Root user

# Terraform EC2 Practice
This folder contains files to practice using **Terraform** with AWS EC2
The goal was to learn Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by provisioning, managing, and destroying an EC2 instance, and automatically installing Nginx as a web server

## What I practiced
- Installing and configuring Terraform
- Setting up AWS CLI and credentials
- Writing a `main.tf` file to define an EC2 instance
- Initializing Terraform with `terraform init`
- Reviewing the execution plan with `terraform plan`
- Applying the configuration with `terraform apply`
- Destroying resources with `terraform destroy`
- Understanding the workflow: **init → plan → apply → destroy**
- Installing and configuring Nginx on the EC2 instance
